# PART 1

# Imaging technique
1. Identify an imaging technique that you find inspiring for your assignment. This could be from an artwork, a design project, a film clip, or a movie.

    - Weighted Voroni stippling 
    - Image to ASCII 
    - Geometric shaping



# Aspect incorporated and beneficial to our project
2. Write a maximum of 100 words discussing which aspect of the example you'd like to incorporate into your project and why you believe it's a beneficial technique considering the assignment requirements.

    - I am a big fan of The Matrix, I am also interested in the effect of decoding and encoding (image to ASCII)in the transformation process during the fight. I hoe to add animated effect during the coding process. The second imaging technique is more abstract which it would be my preferences to represent absract elements of the assignments. In addition, I like the physics principle of "dots make the line" and i was also inspired by the generative portrait which reminds me of the theme of futuristic and unrealistic. The third inspiration that i considered is the geometric shaping. It provides me connection between the previous example and my ecpected theme of the final assignment. I tend try the best to use these technique to represent one of the artwork (the last two pieces), they were fined by distinct lines, simple/flat partitions, and structural design and some of the complex layers that are challenging.

# screenshots and images
3. Include at least 2 high-quality screenshots or images to illustrate your chosen example.

# PART 2

# Coding technique
1. Find a coding technique that could assist in implementing the imaging technique you selected in Part 1 of this quiz.

    - Weighted Voronoi Stippling


# Achievement and contribution
2. In no more than 100 words, discuss how this coding technique might help achieve or or contribute to the desired effect.


    - Weighted Voronoi Stippling
      - It is based on Lloyd's relaxation algorithm, which iteratively moves points in a plane to achieve a distribution that minimizes the weighted sum of the distances between each point and its nearest neighbors.it stippled artworks with a natural and organic feel
    

# Any other language or toolkit
3. You're encouraged to draw inspiration from any coding language or toolkit.

    - Delaunay triangulation
    - LoadPixels
    - HTML (div)
    - asciiImage

- Delaunay triangulation
    - is a geometric technique that helps in creating a mesh of triangles from a set of points in a plane.
    - for generating complex and visually striking patterns in generative art, offering artists a way to create organic, structured, or chaotic designs, depending on their creative intent.
- LoadPixels
    - enabling the creation of dynamic and visually engaging artwork that goes beyond traditional forms of digital art.  
- asciiImage
    - Aesthetic Appeal: ASCII art has a nostalgic and retro aesthetic that appeals to many people. It can evoke feelings of nostalgia or add a vintage touch to modern artworks.
    - Text-Based Animation: By creating a series of ASCII frames and displaying them sequentially, you can create text-based animations. This adds a dynamic element to your generative art projects.
    - Integration with Other Techniques: ASCII art can be combined with other generative art techniques, such as image manipulation or text generation, to create more complex and layered artworks.  


# Image and link
4. Provide an image or screenshot showcasing the coding technique in action, along with a link to an example implementation (including a link to some example code).
